# Localization and SLAM using particle filter 
The aim of this project was to perform particle filter based SLAM using the IMU and the LIDAR data from the robot. The lidar data is transformed into the map co-ordinates by applying suitable transformations. Based on the paricle filter approach the best particle with maximum correlation is chosen and the log odds of the map is updated. 


## Maps built for 4 datasets
